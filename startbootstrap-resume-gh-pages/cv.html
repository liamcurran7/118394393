            <p>Serving customers, making coffees and cleaning cutlery in a busy cafe in Killarney national park run by down syndrome Ireland. Young adults of down syndrome were also helping out in the kitchen which placed a greater responsibility on me as I had to train them in using the cash register and how to deal with customers etc. This was a great learning experience for me.</p>

            <p>Collecting and washing glasses in a busy bar in the middle of Killorglin, Co.Kerry during Puck Fair 2016. This was a great learning experience for me as I was working under severely pressurising circumstances during a hectic period.</p>

            <p>Picking weeds, signing off deliveries andd cutting grass in the main headquarters of a foreign exchange company during the summer months of 2017. I enjoyed this job thoroughly as I was working outdoors in the warm weather. This job was very ambiguous as it had me doing various jobs throughout the day which I enjoyed as my previous jobs were very repetitive.</p>

            <p>Taking orders, delivering food, serving drinks and working behind the bar in a busy restaurant in Killarney at the beginning of summer 2018. I had to resign as my boss would not allow me to take time off to study for my Leaving Certificate which led to me getting a job in Fexco after the exams. However, this was a very valuable learning curve and worthwhile job as waiters are very sought after in terms of summer jobs etc.</p>
