        <h2> Blockchain</h2> <br>
        <p style ="font-size:25px"> Blockchain is globally recognised now as the software that ensures Bitcoin exists. To sum it up, Blockchain can be described as the technology that removes the middle party in a transaction. It can be used for various types of transactions including financial or property. The link below directs you to a website that further describes Blockchain, the cheapest subject for which I offer consultations on.</p>

        <br> <br> <h2>Autonomous Things </h2> <br>
        <p style =" font-size:25px"> Autonomous Things are seen as people or objects that are capable of performing operations independently or by themselves. It is a widely spoken about term when referring to robots and similar devices that are gaining an increased knowledge of how to work on their own. The link below directs you to a website that enlightens you further on autonomous things, in particular robots, a subject for which I provide expertise on at a cheap rate.</p>

        <br><br> <h2>Immersive Experiences</h2> <br>
        <p style ="font-size:25px"> Immersive Experiences or Immersion are both terms used to describe technologies that enable people or the ability of people to engage in software as if they were actually part of the software themselves. Immersion is the next step in modern technology and it enables users to get a grip and understanding of software like never before. Examples of immersive experiences would be virtual reality games or telepresence. The link below directs you to a website that gives you further information on immersive technology and the impact it has and will have on society</p><br>
