            <p style = font-size:20px> From a young age, my father drilled into me the importance of Gaelic football to our family and the impact it had on his life and our ancestors lives. He stressed the importance of the green and gold kerry jersey and also the blue and yellow Beaufort jersey which lit a fire under my belly to wear these colours. I represented Kerry at an underage level and continue to represent Beaufort seniors to this current day. I have great passion for the sport and feel great pride when I watch Kerry compete for All Ireland honours every year.</p> </p>

    <h3> Soccer</h3>
    <p style ="font-size:20px"> As I progressed through my childhood, I fell in love with the beautiful game of soccer. I started at an early age of about 6 with Killarney Athletic and improved and improved until I represented my county at u14. In correlation to my love for playing soccer, I will always have a special place in my heart for Liverpool football club. I felt an instant connection with the club and its fanbase when I started following the sport and I will always be an avid supporter of the club.</p>
