        <h1> Travel</h1> <br>
        <h2> Venice</h2>
        <h3> <img src = https://s27363.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Best-Things-to-do-in-Venice-Italy-1163x775.jpg.optimal.jpg height = 400px width = 800px> </h3> <br>
        <br> <p style ="font-size:25px">I visted Venice with my family when I was 15 and I can honestly say it is the most intriguing city I have ever visited. The unique landscape is complemented by a glamorous culture that really sums up the beauty of Italy. The fact that people travel from place to place on water and only water made me love this place and I would love to visit Venice again.
        <br> <h2> Spain </h2>
        <h3> <img src = https://www.riotgames.com/darkroom/1440/f5f167c525dd1f3989bcfe9ebd3c7995:a842310bd11ee602459b324d098e0e02/barcelona-main.jpg height = 400px width = 800px></h3>
        <br>  <p style = font-size:25px>I have visited Spain on numerous occasions and it is by far my favourite country to visit. With the help of my knowledge of the spanish language from school, I am able to navigate my way around the country at my ease. Pictured above is Barcelona, a city which I have visited many times and a city which I would love to live and start a family in due to its lovely food and weather.
